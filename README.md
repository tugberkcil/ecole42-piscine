# C Piscine @ 42saopaulo

This repository contains coding developed at [42istanbul's](https://www.42sp.org.br/) C bootcamp (also known as `Piscine`), from 31/aug/2021 to 26/sep/2021.

## About 42

	A global education effort called 42 proposes a new approach to teaching technology: 
  peer-to-peer learning, without teachers or classrooms,and a system that fosters both 
  computer and life skills. For anyone is accepted in its selection process, the 42 cursus 
  is free. The final step in the selection process to become a "cadet" (Student 42) 
  is the 26-day C programming bootcamp known as "C Piscine."

## Skills developed at C Piscine

### Hard-skills
	# C Language
		The main language taught at the 42's Piscine is C, which includes learning how to use 
    and create libraries and Makefiles as well as deal with variables, pointers, memory 
    allocation, macros, and functions and programs.

	# Shell
		Learning fundamental to intermediate shell commands is the focus of the first two days 
    of the bootcamp so that participants can move around the terminal with ease.

	# Git
		Since every project must be submitted over a remote git repository, students must be 
    comfortable using this system.

### Soft-skills
	# Self-learning and proactiveness
		The foundation of its peer-to-peer learning methodology, at 42, is self-learning. 
    There aren't any teachers at all; instead, students learn at their own pace while using 
    Google, talking to their peers, and empirical information.

	# Teamwork
	  Weekend team projects called "Rush" need a three-person team to co-create a fully functional 
    application. This project lasts for 48 hours. Equalizing the various expertise levels while 
    identifying a standard work style that enables all team members to contribute to the project 
    is the main problem here.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open twenty-four hours a day. As a result, the so-called "pisciners" are free 
    to work whenever they choose, which necessitates strong time management abilities and resilience 
    to avoid "drowning" under the enormous amount of work required by the nonstop 26-day program.
